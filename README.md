# Computer vision projects

This repo contains my collection of computer vision projects solving real life problems

Watch the video demonstrating the project <a href="https://youtu.be/HgB54rRLwrg" target="_blank">here</a>

The project is divided in three categories: 
- Pure image processing using OpenCV; 
- Leveraging from machine learning models
- Machine learning concepts with examples

Image processing:
- Tracking ball using color range to identify the ball
- Card reader
- Document scanner 
- Simple feature detection - finding Waldo project
- Shape identifier
- Image search using color histogram 
- Image duplication identifier
- Image difference finder
- Multi choice test scanner
- Finger counter

Machine learning models:
- Object classification
- Object detection
- Image segmentation
- Car speed monitor
- People counter
- Face parts detection - detecting different parts of the face (eye, nose, eyebrow, mouth, jaw)
- Mask detector
- Image search using ML Autoencoder
- Neuro style transfer
- Face generation using StyleGan 2
- Image animation

Machine learning concepts:
- What are Convolutions
- Visualizing Intermediate Representations from a model
- A vanilla neural network implementation
- Transfer learning

## How to use
- run the `download_assets.py`. This will download all required files for the examples
- Run the Jupyter notebook example you want to test

## Install dependencies
We provide the requirements.txt file with the required Python dependencies but OpenCV and Tensorflow 
is tricky to install, and you should check on the internet how to install it properly

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
